title: "Temple Run: Why We Play Games We Can't Win"
---

When we play a game, we often work towards winning the game. This is true in multiplayer games, where players may try to outperform each other, and in singleplayer games, where many games have a finite length and a clear objective. However, some of the most popular video games of all time do not follow this pattern. One such example is *Temple Run* (2011) by Imangi Studios. In *Temple Run*, the player controls an explorer who has stolen an idol from a temple. During the game, the player must avoid obstacles as they run from pursuing demon monkeys through the temple's endless paths. Notably, *Temple Run* has no finish line - the game ends when the player's avatar dies. Despite the lack of an end goal, games such as *Temple Run*, *Minecraft*, and *Tetris* have achieved massive commercial success and global popularity. This suggests that **winning games is less important than playing games to many gamers**. The first factor that contributes to this tendency is the inclusion of secondary objectives, often called achievements, in endless games. These give players goals to work toward that may be entirely unrelated to winning the game. The second factor is player-driven objectives. These are goals that are defined by the player themself and have no in-game reward. The third factor is enjoyment of gameplay. Many people play games not to complete objectives, but simply to experience the game. Together, these three factors explain why winning a game is not the only reason people play.
